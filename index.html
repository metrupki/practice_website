                    <h2>Is Pizza Safe For Cats?</h2>
                    <p>Hypothetically, a bite of very plain pizza pie could be safe for your feline, as long as they don’t usually show any ill signs after eating dairy. 
                        Feeding your cat pizza is far more likely to be safer if you make the pizza yourself and know exactly what ingredients are going into it.
                        Unfortunately, the problem with pizza is that it provides little in the way of nutrition that your cat needs, even if you make it with safe ingredients.
                        Due to the wide variety in pizzas and toppings, you also risk inadvertently feeding your cat something that they might be allergic to — or worse, something toxic.</p>

                <p>There’s nothing like settling down on the couch at the end of the day and binge-watching your way through the latest shows while chowing down on a freshly delivered pizza. But could your cat also get in on the act? Can cats eat pizza?

                    The short answer is, well, sort of, but mostly no. While pizza might be okay in some cases for your cat to snack on, it’s not a food that provides vital feline nutrition, and you can also risk sneaking in toppings or seasonings that might make your kitty ill.
                    
                    Let’s dig into the details about cats and pizza.</p>

                <p>The best practice is to only allow your cat a very small morsel of pizza from time to time. Make sure it’s a pretty plain slice, and always monitor your cat straight after the snacking to make sure there are no signs of illness or discomfort.</p>
