                <h2>Is Pizza Safe For Cats?</h2>
                <p>Hypothetically, a bite of very plain pizza pie could be safe for your feline, as long as they don’t usually show any ill signs after eating dairy. 
                    Feeding your cat pizza is far more likely to be safer if you make the pizza yourself and know exactly what ingredients are going into it.
                    Unfortunately, the problem with pizza is that it provides little in the way of nutrition that your cat needs, even if you make it with safe ingredients.
                    Due to the wide variety in pizzas and toppings, you also risk inadvertently feeding your cat something that they might be allergic to — or worse, something toxic.</p>
